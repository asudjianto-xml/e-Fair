# e-Fair: An Îµ-Budget Information-Theoretic Fairness Framework

**e-Fair** is a practical and rigorous framework for algorithmic fairness that treats fairness as an **explicit information budget**.  
Instead of relying on ad-hoc penalties, e-Fair constrains the mutual information leakage between protected attributes **A** and predictions **Å¶**:

\[
I(A;\hat Y) \;\leq\; \epsilon
\]

This gives practitioners a clear **budget Îµ** to spend on fairness, while still optimizing utility.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Ideas

- **Îµ-Budget Fairness**  
  Control fairness explicitly via information-theoretic constraints (mutual information).
  
- **Theoretical Backbone**  
  Based on Pinsker-type inequalities, impossibility theorems, and Îµ-constraint optimization.

- **Practical Realization**  
  - **Binning & Monotonicity**: Stabilize predictions, enforce regulatory constraints.  
  - **Exact Optimization**: Dynamic programming (DP) or Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solves Îµ-constraint problems exactly.  
  - **Fairnessâ€“Utility Frontier**: Sweep over Îµ to visualize trade-offs.  

- **General & Extensible**  
  Works for categorical, continuous scores, multi-task settings, and temporal monitoring.
